# Hello everyone !

## So this is the updated (latest) source code for Studysense.


# For source code installation
To test this software -\
	1. `git clone https://github.com/MashukeAlam/Surf.git`\
	2. `cd Studysense`\
	3. `npm install`\
	4. `npm start`
	

For the third step you must have to have NPM install. Don't know if it works (isn't tested)
Then you can change/edit the source code. After that for creating a public build - \
	5. `npm run make` 
	
:blush:
	
# Some restrictions
Please don't publish your personally modified version of this app to public without my knowledge. :sunglasses: ** You can however use it in your own PC.

<b>And please never mess with these files below:</b>\
	1. /src/about.html\
	2. /src/renderer.js\
	3. /package-lock.json\
